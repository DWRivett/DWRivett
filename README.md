- 👋 Hi, I’m @DWRivett
- 👀 I’m a Microbiology lecturer interested in all things related to microbial ecology.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching how bacterial interactions (with themselves and other microorganisms) impact on the ecosystems we depend on.
- 💞️ I’ll be using this platform to deposit the code used in studies and learning and teaching resources that I'd love improve with other like-minded individuals!
- 📫 I'm new to all this, but you can reach me at d.rivett@mmu.ac.uk or on Twitter @DWRivett
